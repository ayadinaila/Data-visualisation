# Data-visualisation
Objective Data Visualization let's practice what we have learned so far and visualize some data !  In order to validate this checkpoint you are asked to accomplish the following tasks:  Preprocessing part After importing the dataset using Pandas start by showing the head of the dataset then some general information about the data columns and values  As a next step apply what you have learned in the course to preprocess your data: find missing informations and replace them by the appropriate values.  Verify that your data is ready to be treated.  2. Visualization part  Let’s begin now the data visualization part :   Start by studying the distribution of the most important features based on your understanding of the dataset and the problem    Visualize the correlation between Sex and Age in a plot of your choosing, the visualized plot should give us obvious deductions concerning the importance of age and Sex in the survival of the individuals.  Pick two other features and study their impact on the survival of the individuals   Have a look at this function:  def plot_correlation_map( df ):      corr = df.corr()      s , ax = plt.subplots( figsize =( 12 , 10 ) )      cmap = sns.diverging_palette( 220 , 10 , as_cmap = True )      s = sns.heatmap(          corr,           cmap = cmap,          square=True,           cbar_kws={ 'shrink' : .9 },           ax=ax,           annot = True,           annot_kws = { 'fontsize' : 12 }          )  Try running the function, analyse what does it do exactly and what are the utilities of it, write a paragraph describing your analysis (the paragraph should be in english)  Use the groupby function combined with the mean() to view the relation between Pclass and survived   As a final step try to drop the useless columns such as Names  In fact, we dropped the column Names because we evaluated it as useless, well that's not the case, we can create a very useful feature from the names  your task now is to create a new column called Title which contain the appropriate Title for each individual ( hint : extract the title from the column Names)  Visualize the correlation between Title and other features(e.g Sex, Fare, Age...)  As you should've seen, there is a lot of titles which makes the feature not very practical, let's try to group these titles into more useful ones  hint: use the following dictionary  Title_Dictionary = {                      "Capt":       "Officer",                      "Col":        "Officer",                      "Major":      "Officer",                        "Dr":         "Officer",                      "Rev":        "Officer”,                      "Jonkheer":   "Royalty",                      "Don":        "Royalty",                      "Sir" :       "Royalty",                     "Lady" :      "Royalty"                    "the Countess": "Royalty",                      "Dona":       "Royalty”,                      "Mme":        "Miss",                      "Mlle":       "Miss",                      "Miss" :      "Miss",                      "Ms":         "Mrs",                      "Mr" :        "Mrs",                      "Mrs" :       "Mrs                      "Master" :    "Master"                      }  let's visualize the same correlations using these new titles now.  Finally, use the Parch and the SibSp columns to create a more useful feature, let's call it FamilySize.  Use what you have learned so far to conclude if this feature is useful or not.
